                    LINDA’s Designated Copyright Agent, identified in the sample Notice below.<br/>
                    To file a copyright infringement notification with LINDA (“Notice”), you will need to send a written
                    communication that includes substantially the following (please consult your legal counsel or see
                    Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA to confirm these requirements):
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
                      exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted
                      works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such
                      works at that site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
                      activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information
                      reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material. Providing URLs in the
                      body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party,
                      such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the
                      complaining party may be contacted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the
                      manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
                      that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that
                      is allegedly infringed.

                    information sufficient for LINDA to verify that the registered user or other account holder is an
                    infringer.
